# Arabic Sign Language ArSL Recognition using LSTM
 Arabic Sign Languages  contains static and dynamic signs, most datasets are not normalized, and  the changes in setting of imaging device may affect quality. This makes  it a challenging problem that would require Deep Learning techniques  to be solved. Previous attempts to tackle this problem, in similar Sign  Languages (Iraqi, etc.) have showed the importance of extracting the  required details using Mediapipe. The focus on sequences of Mediapipe extracted features relatively increased inference speed, given Mediapipeâ€™s  lightweight API. First, using OpenCV and Mediapipe, videos  were divided into frames and each frame was fed into Mediapipe for land marks. Then the Deep Neural Network received the input matrix with  the true labels to begin learning. Training the LSTM-based model on  around 2500 videos using dual Tesla T4 GPUs from Kaggle and Google  Colab helped us achieve over 98 % accuracy. Our implementation was  trained using TensorFlow and Keras. The model covered all letters, num bers, and a range of 18 words, mostly action verbs.
